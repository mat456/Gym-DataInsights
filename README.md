# GymDataInsights

This project aims to help a gym owner better understand her business. The data analysis includes:
- The evolution of income over time
- The distribution of membership plans chosen by clients
- The evolution of class attendance by clients
- A simulation of past income if the best-selling membership plan had been sold at a higher price
- The relationship between the number of classes attended and the amount of money spent by clients
